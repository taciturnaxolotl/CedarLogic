<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the CEDAR digital logic simulator. In this tutorial, you 
 will learn the basics of CEDAR logic. While every piece of functionality 
 has not been covered exhaustively in this tutorial, it should give you 
 the basic foundation you will need to use the program. </p>

<p>In this 3 module tutorial, you will build and edit a full adder circuit. 
 Each module builds upon the previous one, therefore it is recommended 
 you do them in order. The first module is a basic getting started tutorial, 
 the second module covers basic user interface features, and the third 
 module covers advanced circuit simulation features. </p>

<p>Now, sit back, relax, grab your mouse, and prepare yourself for the 
 ultimate logic simulation experience.</p>
