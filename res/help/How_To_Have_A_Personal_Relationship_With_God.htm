 To Have A Personal Relationship With God</h1>

<p class="hcp1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hcp1">We owe all of our success in this project 
 to God and His Son Jesus Christ. If you do not know God, it is our prayer 
 that you will come to know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.</p>

<p style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">1. God Loves You &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>God loves everyone and he desires us to have eternal life. John 3:16 
 says, &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, 
 that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. And, 
 John 10:10 says, &quot;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; 
 I (Jesus) have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.&quot; 
 (NIV)</p>

<p class="hcp2">2. You Are A Sinner In Need Of Forgiveness 
 </p>

<p>You have sinned by choosing to go your own way instead of God's way. 
 Through His Holy Spirit, God wants you to know that you are seperated 
 from God and will face His judgement. Romans 3:23 says, &quot;for all 
 have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&quot;. Romans 6:23 says, 
 &quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life 
 in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot; And, Heb 9:27 says, &quot;Just as man 
 is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,&quot; (NIV)</p>

<p class="hcp2">3. God Wants To Forgive You</p>

<p>God demonstrated His love for you by sending His Son, Jesus Christ. 
 By dying on the cross and rising from the dead, Jesus took your judgement 
 and made it possible for you to be forgiven. Romans 5:8 says, &quot;But 
 God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, 
 Christ died for us.&quot; And, 1 Pet 3:18 says, &quot;For Christ died 
 for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you 
 to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, 
 (NIV)</p>

<p class="hcp2">4. You Must Turn Away From Your Sins</p>

<p>You cannot save yourself or earn God's forgiveness as a result of being 
 good enough. Just as you change directions when you realize you're walking 
 the wrong way, you must repent, or turn away, from you sins. Luke 13:5 
 says, &quot;I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.&quot; 
 And, Ephesians 2:8-9 say, &quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, 
 through faith-- and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not 
 by works, so that no one can boast.&quot; (NIV)</p>

<p class="hcp2">5. You Must Place Your Faith In God's Son, 
 Jesus Christ</p>

<p>When you realize you are walking in the wrong direction, you turn to 
 find the right way. Jesus is the right way. As you turn away from your 
 sins, place your faith in Jesus to receive forgiveness and eternal life. 
 Acts 20:21 says, &quot;I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they 
 must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.&quot; 
 And, John 14:6 says, &quot;Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the 
 truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; 
 (NIV)</p>

<p class="hcp2">6. You Receive Jesus Christ Through Prayer</p>

<p>Because Jesus is alive, He stands ready to come into your life. Revelations 
 3:20 says, &quot;Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears 
 my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with 
 me.&quot; (NIV) Through prayer you can:</p>

<p><span class="hcp3">A</span>dmit to God 
 that you are a sinner and that you are turning away from you sins;</p>

<p><span class="hcp3">B</span>elieve in 
 Jesus by thanking Him for dying on the cross and rising from the dead 
 for your sins;</p>

<p><span class="hcp3">C</span>ommit your 
 life to Jesus by asking Him to come into your life as your Savior and 
 Lord.</p>

<p>After you have prayed this prayer, try to find a local church where 
 you can worship and learn more about Jesus. Also, commit to a daily quiet 
 time, reading your Bible and praying. Also, call 1-888-NEED-HIM to talk 
 to someone about your decision or if you have more questions.</p>
