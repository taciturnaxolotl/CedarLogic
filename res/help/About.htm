<p><span style="font-style: italic;">CEDAR logic was developed by Ben Sprague, 
 Matthew Lewellyn, and David Knierim for a Senior design project for Cedarville 
 University during the 2005-2006 academic year.</span> </p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">It was extended during the 2006-2007 academic 
 year to include a Z80 microprocessor by Cedarville students Joshua Lansford 
 and Nathan Harro.</p>

<p><a name=About></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Goal</span></p>

<p>Cedarville University currently utilizes the Diglog digital logic simulation 
 program in its freshman level course called Digital Logic Design (DLD). 
 This course is required for many math, science, and engineering majors 
 and gives students a basic understanding of what digital logic is and 
 its many uses. The instructor, Dr. Kohl, has asked us to redesign the 
 current digital logic simulator to make it run more efficiently. He has 
 also asked us to add a modern user interface to make the program easier 
 to use for students. In this project, we will design a digital logic simulator 
 to meet the school's current needs.</p>

<p>With the addition of the Z80 chip, CedarLogic is now useful not only 
 to DLD students, but also to students in Microprocessor labs.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
 would like to thank Ben Sprague and Matthew Lewellyn for being the best 
 Senior Design partners I could ever ask for. You guys have been great. 
 It has been a privilege to work with you these last few months.</p>

<p class="hcp2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span 
 style="font-weight: normal;">If you are reading 
 this as a Freshman in engineering, I just want to encourage you to enjoy 
 college. You are entering a very rigorous major, but make sure you take 
 time to stop and enjoy life. Do your best in school, but also do your 
 best in relationships. Don't forget to stop and smell the roses. God has 
 a lot He wants to teach you in college. Be willing and able and He will 
 do the rest.</span></p>
